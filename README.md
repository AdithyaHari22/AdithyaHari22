# Hi, I'm Adithya Hari 👋

I'm a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology, pursuing Applied AI with a focus on Data Engineering. My passion lies in building robust, scalable data pipelines that transform raw data into actionable insights. I am deeply committed to mastering data engineering, and I constantly explore innovative techniques and tools to push the boundaries of what data systems can do.

While data engineering is my main focus, I also take a keen interest in soccer analytics and natural language processing. I am particularly fascinated by how NLP can be applied to detect misinformation and make AI models more transparent through explainable AI. I enjoy exploring the intersection of these fields and investigating how emerging AI innovations can be seamlessly integrated into data engineering pipelines.
